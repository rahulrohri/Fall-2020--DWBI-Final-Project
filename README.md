## Final Project for IS 525 AO FA20: Data Warehousing - University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign
## Analysis of the ATP world tour tennis dataset

## Project Overview
# Analysis of the ATP world tour tennis dataset 
The ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) is the governing body of the men's professional tennis circuits - the ATP Tour, the ATP Challenger Tour and the ATP Champions Tour. With 64 tournaments in 31 countries, the ATP Tour showcases the finest male athletes competing in the worldâ€™s most exciting venues. From Australia to Europe and the Americas to Asia, the stars of the 2020 ATP Tour will battle for prestigious titles and FedEx ATP Rankings points at ATP Tour Masters 1000, 500 and 250 events, as well as Grand Slams (non-ATP events).</br>
</br>
The aim of my final project is to deep dive into the ATP world tour dataset and find out the correlation between a few key data points that are being captured. Being an avid Tennis fan, I have always had a few key questions which I wanted to explore and find more information on. Today, with ATP maintaining up to date match stats on their website, obtaining such information is very easy, however finding trends between the same requires some additional effort. My end goal is that using my Tableau dashboard, instead of referring to the ATP website and referring multiple pages to find data, there is a single place where one can refer to for the statistics.

## Datasets used for my analysis
The datasets have tennis statistics updated till the year 2017.I will be referring to 2 datasets which will contain information about various metrics pertaining to ATP tournaments, match scores, match stats, rankings and players overview . For this project , I will not be utilizing the rankings data since that is not a part of my analysis. There are roughly 7-10 csv files (Around 60MB in total) which I will be using for my analysis.
